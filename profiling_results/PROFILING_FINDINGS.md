# Nsys Profiling Results: TR Overhead Quantification

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Token Reduction (TR) makes the **GPU computationally faster** at BOTH input sizes, but system-level overhead causes overall slowdown at small input sizes.

### Key Finding: GPU Time vs System Throughput Mismatch

| Configuration | GPU Time (ms) | Kernel Count | Real Throughput |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **is=224 bs=1 baseline** | 154.34 | 6,856 | 152.7 img/s |
| **is=224 bs=1 WITH TR** | **82.39 (-46.6%)** | 7,422 (+566) | **137.3 img/s (-10%)** |
| **is=448 bs=8 baseline** | 568.49 | 6,855 | 32.8 img/s |
| **is=448 bs=8 WITH TR** | **243.60 (-57.1%)** | 7,370 (+515) | **73.6 img/s (+124%)** |

**The Paradox Explained:**
- At **is=224**: GPU is 46.6% faster, but system throughput is 10% slower
- At **is=448**: GPU is 57.1% faster, and system throughput is 124% faster

## 1. GPU Kernel Execution Analysis

### is=224 bs=1: Fast GPU, Slow System

```
Baseline GPU time:  154.34 ms
With TR GPU time:    82.39 ms
GPU Speedup:        -71.95 ms (-46.6%)

Baseline throughput: 152.7 img/s (6.55 ms/image)
With TR throughput:  137.3 img/s (7.29 ms/image)
System Slowdown:    +0.74 ms/image (+11.3%)
```

**Analysis:**
- GPU computation is **significantly faster** (-71.95 ms saved)
- But system adds ~72.7 ms of overhead elsewhere
- **Net result:** 0.74 ms slower per image

**Where does the overhead come from?**
1. **Kernel launch overhead:** 566 additional kernel launches
2. **CPU/GPU synchronization:** More frequent data transfers
3. **Memory management:** Additional allocations/deallocations for TopK operations
4. **Small kernel inefficiency:** Average kernel time drops from 22.51μs to 11.10μs

### is=448 bs=8: Fast GPU, Fast System

```
Baseline GPU time:  568.49 ms
With TR GPU time:   243.60 ms
GPU Speedup:       -324.89 ms (-57.1%)

Baseline throughput: 32.8 img/s (30.50 ms/image)
With TR throughput:  73.6 img/s (13.59 ms/image)
System Speedup:     -16.91 ms/image (-55.4%)
```

**Analysis:**
- GPU computation is **massively faster** (-324.89 ms saved)
- System overhead is ~324.9 - 135.3 = ~190 ms
- **Net result:** 16.91 ms faster per image (2.24x speedup)

**Why does TR win here?**
1. **Computational savings dominate:** 325 ms saved >> ~190 ms overhead
2. **Larger kernels remain efficient:** Average kernel time 33.05μs (still substantial)
3. **Token count scaling:** 784 tokens → 78 tokens saves 608k attention operations

## 2. Kernel Launch Overhead Analysis

### Kernel Count Comparison

| Configuration | Total Kernels | Kernels Added by TR | Avg Kernel Time |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| is=224 bs=1 baseline | 6,856 | - | 22.51 μs |
| is=224 bs=1 WITH TR | 7,422 | **+566 (8.3%)** | **11.10 μs (-51%)** |
| is=448 bs=8 baseline | 6,855 | - | 82.93 μs |
| is=448 bs=8 WITH TR | 7,370 | **+515 (7.5%)** | **33.05 μs (-60%)** |

**Observations:**
1. TR adds ~500-560 extra kernel launches across configurations
2. Average kernel execution time **drops significantly** with TR:
   - At is=224: 22.51μs → 11.10μs (kernels become 2x smaller)
   - At is=448: 82.93μs → 33.05μs (kernels become 2.5x smaller)

3. **Small kernels are inefficient** on GPUs due to:
   - Kernel launch overhead (~5-10 μs per launch)
   - Reduced occupancy
   - Memory latency dominating compute

### Estimated TR Overhead Breakdown

**Per-forward-pass overhead (3 TR layers at locations 3, 6, 9):**

```
Operation                    Est. Time (μs)  Count   Total (μs)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TopK selection kernels       10-15           3       30-45
Gather operations            5-10            3       15-30
Index computations           3-5             3       9-15
Reduce/Mean kernels          5-8             3       15-24
Bitonic sort (if needed)     8-12            3       24-36
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL per forward pass:                              93-150 μs
```

**With warmup of 20 iterations:**
- Total TR overhead: 93-150 μs × 20 = 1.86-3.0 ms

**But we see much larger overhead (~73 ms at is=224), indicating:**
1. CPU-side overhead (Python, PyTorch dispatching)
2. GPU-CPU synchronization delays
3. Memory allocation/deallocation overhead
4. Reduced GPU occupancy from smaller kernels

---

## 3. Why Input Size Is Critical

### Token Count Math

```
is=224: 14×14 = 196 tokens
  keep 10% = ~20 tokens
  eliminate = 176 tokens

is=448: 28×28 = 784 tokens
  keep 10% = ~78 tokens
  eliminate = 706 tokens

Ratio: 706/176 = 4.01x more tokens eliminated at is=448
```

### Computational Savings

**Attention complexity: O(n²)**
```
is=224 savings:
  196² → 20²
  = 38,416 → 400 operations
  = 38,016 ops saved per layer

is=448 savings:
  784² → 78²
  = 614,656 → 6,084 operations
  = 608,572 ops saved per layer

Ratio: 608,572 / 38,016 = 16.0x more attention ops saved at is=448
```

**MLP complexity: O(n)**
```
is=224 savings: 196 → 20 = 176 ops saved
is=448 savings: 784 → 78 = 706 ops saved
Ratio: 706 / 176 = 4.01x more MLP ops saved
```

### Break-Even Analysis

**At is=224:**
- Computational savings: ~38k attention + 176 MLP ops ≈ **low**
- TR overhead: ~93-150 μs + system overhead ≈ **high relative to savings**
- **Result:** Overhead > savings → slower

**At is=448:**
- Computational savings: ~608k attention + 706 MLP ops ≈ **very high**
- TR overhead: ~93-150 μs + system overhead ≈ **small relative to savings**
- **Result:** Savings >> overhead → much faster

**Estimated break-even point:** ~400 tokens (~20×20 patches, ~320×320 input size)

## 4. Comparison with Real-World Performance

### is=224 bs=1

| Metric | Baseline | TR | Change |
|--------|----------|----|---------|
| GPU time (nsys) | 154.34 ms | 82.39 ms | -46.6% |
| Real latency (speed_test) | 6.55 ms | 7.29 ms | +11.3% |
| **Discrepancy** | | | **GPU 46% faster, system 11% slower** |

**Interpretation:**
- GPU profiling captures only CUDA kernel execution
- Real-world includes: CPU processing, memory transfers, Python overhead, kernel launches
- At small sizes, non-GPU overhead dominates

### is=448 bs=8

| Metric | Baseline | TR | Change |
|--------|----------|----|---------|
| GPU time (nsys) | 568.49 ms | 243.60 ms | -57.1% |
| Real latency (speed_test) | 30.50 ms | 13.59 ms | -55.4% |
| **Alignment** | | | **Very close match** |

**Interpretation:**
- GPU time and real-world performance align well
- At large sizes, GPU compute dominates total time
- System overhead becomes negligible relative to savings

## 5. Top Kernel Analysis

### is=224 bs=1: Kernel Time Distribution

**Baseline top kernels:**
- Kernel 281 (likely elementwise): 27.3% of time
- Kernel 324 (likely GEMM): 24.7% of time
- Kernel 340 (likely attention): 12.2% of time

**TR top kernels:**
- Kernel 257: 33.3% of time (increased dominance)
- Kernel 295: 15.6% of time
- Kernel 398 (likely conv): 8.6% of time

**Key change:** Kernel distribution becomes more concentrated with TR, suggesting:
1. TR reduces attention kernel time significantly
2. Remaining operations (conv, elementwise) become proportionally larger
3. More small kernels launched

### is=448 bs=8: Kernel Time Distribution

**Baseline top kernels:**
- Kernel 299 (GEMM): 23.9% of time
- Kernel 291: 22.0% of time
- Kernel 260 (elementwise): 14.9% of time

**TR top kernels:**
- Kernel 267: 24.1% of time
- Kernel 338: 14.5% of time
- Kernel 304: 13.7% of time

**Key change:** TR reduces total time while maintaining similar kernel distribution, suggesting:
1. All kernels benefit from reduced sequence length
2. Overhead is proportionally smaller
3. GPU remains well-utilized

## 6. Key Insights

### 1. TR Reduces GPU Computation at Both Sizes

**Contrary to initial hypothesis**, TR makes GPU computation faster even at is=224:
- is=224: -46.6% GPU time
- is=448: -57.1% GPU time

### 2. System Overhead Is the Bottleneck at Small Sizes

The performance paradox is explained by **system-level overhead**:
- CPU processing time
- Kernel launch overhead (~500-560 extra launches)
- GPU-CPU synchronization
- Memory management
- Python/PyTorch dispatching

### 3. Kernel Launch Overhead Scales with Token Count

**Overhead is relatively fixed** (~93-150 μs per forward pass), but:
- At is=224: 93-150 μs overhead vs ~154 ms baseline = 0.06-0.10%
- At is=448: 93-150 μs overhead vs ~568 ms baseline = 0.016-0.026%

The overhead becomes **negligible** at large sizes but **significant** at small sizes.

### 4. Average Kernel Size Matters

TR creates **many small kernels**:
- is=224: Average kernel time drops from 22.51μs to 11.10μs (-51%)
- is=448: Average kernel time drops from 82.93μs to 33.05μs (-60%)

**Small kernels are inefficient** due to:
- Launch overhead dominates
- Poor occupancy
- Memory latency

### 5. Token Count, Not Batch Size, Determines Benefit

From validation results:
- is=224: TR consistently slower across all batch sizes (1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
- is=448: TR consistently faster for most batch sizes (except bs=4 anomaly)

**Batch size has minimal impact** compared to token count.

---

## 7. Recommendations

### For Practitioners

**Use TR when:**
- Input size ≥ 384×384 (~576 tokens)
- High-resolution images, videos, or dense prediction tasks
- Computational budget is critical
- Slight accuracy drop (3-5%) is acceptable

**Avoid TR when:**
- Input size ≤ 256×256 (~256 tokens)
- Standard ImageNet-1k classification (224×224)
- Maximum accuracy is required
- Real-time inference with tight latency requirements

### For Researchers

**Future work:**
1. **Reduce system overhead:**
   - Kernel fusion to reduce launch count
   - Custom CUDA kernels for TR operations
   - Optimize TopK/gather implementations

2. **Adaptive TR strategies:**
   - Dynamic keep rate based on input size
   - Different reduction locations
   - Layer-specific keep rates

3. **Profile with ncu:**
   - Detailed occupancy analysis
   - Memory bandwidth utilization
   - Identify specific bottlenecks in TR operations

4. **Investigate bs=4 anomaly:**
   - Why is bs=4 slower at is=448?
   - GPU scheduling artifacts?
   - Cache effects?

## 8. Conclusions

### The TR Paradox Solved

Token Reduction exhibits a **GPU-system performance mismatch**:

| Aspect | is=224 | is=448 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| GPU computation | **46.6% faster** | **57.1% faster** |
| System overhead | **Dominates savings** | **Negligible relative to savings** |
| Real-world result | 11% slower | 124% faster |

### Why FLOPs Don't Predict Performance

Both configurations show ~68% FLOPs reduction:
- is=224: 17.57 GF → 5.55 GF (-68.4%)
- is=448: 78.52 GF → 24.73 GF (-68.5%)

But performance varies dramatically:
- is=224: 11% **slower**
- is=448: 124% **faster**

**Conclusion:** FLOPs measure theoretical computation, not real-world performance. System-level factors (kernel launches, CPU overhead, synchronization) dominate at small scales.

### Final Insight

Token Reduction is fundamentally a **scale-dependent optimization**:
- At small scales: Fixed overhead > computational savings
- At large scales: Computational savings >> fixed overhead

The break-even point (~400 tokens) depends on hardware, batch size, and implementation efficiency.
